    # Example 1: Installation and Setup

This example shows how to install the Google Gen AI Python SDK and set up the necessary environment for working with the Live API.

```python
# Install the Google Gen AI SDK
%pip install --upgrade --quiet google-genai

# Import necessary libraries
import os
from google import genai

# Set up Google Cloud project information
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"  # Replace with your project ID
if not PROJECT_ID or PROJECT_ID == "[your-project-id]":
    PROJECT_ID = str(os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"))

LOCATION = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION", "us-central1")

# Create the client with Vertex AI
client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

# Set the model ID for Gemini 2.0 Flash
MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09"
```

## Explanation

This code performs the initial setup required to use the Google Gen AI SDK with the Gemini Live API:

1. **Installation**:

   - Uses pip to install the `google-genai` package, which provides the Python client for Google's Generative AI.
   - The `--quiet` flag minimizes output, and `--upgrade` ensures you have the latest version.

2. **Project Configuration**:

   - Sets up the `PROJECT_ID` variable identifying your Google Cloud project.
   - Includes a fallback mechanism to retrieve the project ID from environment variables if not explicitly specified.
   - Defines the `LOCATION` variable (defaulting to "us-central1") which determines the Google Cloud region where API resources are accessed.

3. **Client Initialization**:

   - Creates a `genai.Client` instance configured to use Vertex AI.
   - Provides the project ID and location for proper API routing.
   - This client object will be used for all interactions with the Gemini models.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Sets the `MODEL_ID` to "gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09", which is the Gemini 2.0 Flash model with Live API capabilities.
   - This model provides a balance of quality and speed suitable for real-time applications.

These configuration steps are essential before using any of the Live API features, as they establish the connection to Google Cloud and specify which model to use.
