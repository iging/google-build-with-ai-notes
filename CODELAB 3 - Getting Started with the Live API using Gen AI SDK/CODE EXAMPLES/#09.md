# Example 9: Google Search Tool with Live API

This example demonstrates how to use the Google Search tool with the Live API to allow the model to search for real-time information.

```python
import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import LiveConnectConfig, Content, Part, Tool, GoogleSearch
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

async def google_search_example():
    # Initialize the client (assuming it's already been set up)
    # client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

    # Set the model
    MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09"

    # Configure the session with Google Search tool
    config = LiveConnectConfig(
        response_modalities=["TEXT"],
        tools=[Tool(google_search=GoogleSearch())],
    )

    # Create the session
    async with client.aio.live.connect(
        model=MODEL_ID,
        config=config,
    ) as session:
        # Define a query that requires up-to-date information
        text_input = "Tell me about the latest Mars rover mission and any recent discoveries"
        display(Markdown(f"**Input:** {text_input}"))

        # Send the input to the model
        await session.send_client_content(
            turns=Content(role="user", parts=[Part(text=text_input)])
        )

        # Collect and display the response
        response = []
        async for message in session.receive():
            if message.text:
                response.append(message.text)

        # Display the complete response, which should include information from web searches
        display(Markdown(f"**Response:** {''.join(response)}"))

# Run the example (in a notebook, you would use await google_search_example())
# asyncio.run(google_search_example())
```

## Explanation

This code demonstrates how to use the Google Search tool with the Gemini Live API:

1. **Tool Configuration**:

   - Sets up the Google Search tool using `Tool(google_search=GoogleSearch())`
   - Includes this tool in the `LiveConnectConfig` to enable web search capabilities
   - This allows the model to search the internet for current information

2. **Query Selection**:

   - The example uses a query about Mars rover missions that might require up-to-date information
   - This demonstrates how the model can access information beyond its training data
   - Ideal for questions about:
     - Recent events
     - Current facts and figures
     - Changing information
     - Specialized knowledge not in training data

3. **Search Integration**:

   - When the model identifies information gaps in its knowledge
   - It automatically decides when to use search (no explicit command needed)
   - Integrates search results seamlessly into its responses

4. **Response Construction**:

   - The model synthesizes information from multiple sources:
     - Its own training data for background knowledge
     - Web search results for current information
   - Creates a coherent, contextual response that combines both

5. **Key Benefits**:

   - **Reduced hallucination**: Less likely to invent facts since it can verify information
   - **Up-to-date information**: Access to recent information beyond training cut-off
   - **Coverage of niche topics**: Can find specialized information
   - **Transparency**: Can cite sources when appropriate

6. **Implementation Details**:
   - Response processing is similar to basic text generation
   - Search happens behind the scenes - the API handles all search operations
   - Results are automatically filtered for relevance and quality

This feature significantly enhances the model's utility for information-seeking tasks, creating a more capable assistant that can ground its responses in current web information when needed.
