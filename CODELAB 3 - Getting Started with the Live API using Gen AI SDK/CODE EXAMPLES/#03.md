# Example 3: Importing Required Libraries for Live API

This example shows how to import all the necessary libraries and types for working with the Gemini Live API.

```python
# Import display utilities from IPython
from IPython.display import Audio, Markdown, display

# Import Generative AI types for Live API
from google.genai.types import (
    AudioTranscriptionConfig,
    Content,
    GoogleSearch,
    LiveConnectConfig,
    Part,
    PrebuiltVoiceConfig,
    ProactivityConfig,
    SpeechConfig,
    Tool,
    ToolCodeExecution,
    VoiceConfig,
)

# For array operations (especially with audio data)
import numpy as np
```

## Explanation

This code imports the necessary libraries and types for working with the Gemini Live API:

1. **IPython Display Utilities**:

   - `Audio`: Enables the rendering and playback of audio in the notebook environment.
   - `Markdown`: Allows formatted text display in notebooks.
   - `display`: The general display function used to render various output types.

2. **Generative AI Types**:

   - These are specialized classes from the `google.genai.types` module designed for the Live API:
     - `AudioTranscriptionConfig`: Used to configure audio transcription settings.
     - `Content`: Represents content sent to or received from the model.
     - `GoogleSearch`: Tool that enables the model to perform web searches.
     - `LiveConnectConfig`: Configuration settings for Live API sessions.
     - `Part`: Individual components (text, audio, etc.) within content.
     - `PrebuiltVoiceConfig` and `VoiceConfig`: Used to specify voice characteristics.
     - `ProactivityConfig`: Configures proactive behavior in the model.
     - `SpeechConfig`: Speech generation configuration.
     - `Tool` and `ToolCodeExecution`: Enable function calling and code execution.

3. **NumPy**:
   - Essential for numerical operations, particularly when handling audio data.
   - Used to process and manipulate binary audio data received from the Live API.
   - Provides functions for array operations like concatenation (`np.concatenate`).

These imports provide the foundation for all Live API interactions, from simple text conversations to complex audio processing and tool usage. Each type represents a specific aspect of the API's capabilities and is used in different scenarios depending on your application's needs.
