# Example 4: Text-to-Text Generation with Live API

This example demonstrates how to use the Live API for text-based interactions with Gemini.

```python
import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import LiveConnectConfig, Content, Part
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

async def text_to_text_example():
    # Initialize the client (assuming it's already been set up)
    # client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

    # Set the model
    MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09"

    # Create a session with text response modality
    async with client.aio.live.connect(
        model=MODEL_ID,
        config=LiveConnectConfig(response_modalities=["TEXT"]),
    ) as session:
        # Define the input text
        text_input = "Hello? Gemini are you there?"
        display(Markdown(f"**Input:** {text_input}"))

        # Send the input to the model
        await session.send_client_content(
            turns=Content(role="user", parts=[Part(text=text_input)])
        )

        # Collect the response
        response = []
        async for message in session.receive():
            if message.text:
                response.append(message.text)

        # Display the full response
        display(Markdown(f"**Response:** {''.join(response)}"))

# Run the example (in a notebook, you would use await text_to_text_example())
# asyncio.run(text_to_text_example())
```

## Explanation

This code demonstrates a basic text-to-text interaction with Gemini using the Live API:

1. **Session Initialization**:

   - Creates an asynchronous context using `client.aio.live.connect`
   - Configures the session with `LiveConnectConfig` to specify text response modality
   - The `async with` construct ensures proper resource management for the WebSocket connection

2. **Request Construction**:

   - Creates a simple text query ("Hello? Gemini are you there?")
   - Builds a structured request using `Content` and `Part` objects:
     - `Content` defines the user role and contains Parts
     - `Part` contains the actual text content
   - Sends the request using `session.send_client_content()`

3. **Response Processing**:

   - Uses an asynchronous loop (`async for`) to receive messages as they stream from the API
   - Checks each message for text content and appends it to the response list
   - The streaming approach allows for handling partial responses as they arrive

4. **Display**:

   - Formats the response using Markdown for better readability
   - Concatenates all response fragments into a single string

5. **Key Features Demonstrated**:
   - Asynchronous communication with the Gemini model
   - Structured request formatting
   - Response streaming and collection
   - Clean session management with context managers

This pattern forms the foundation for more complex interactions with the Live API, where the same basic flow (establish connection, send request, process response) is used regardless of modality.
