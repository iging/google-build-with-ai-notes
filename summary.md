# GDG Build with AI Workshop: Codelabs Summary

This document provides a summary of the three codelabs included in the GDG Build with AI workshop materials.

## Overview

The workshop consists of three progressive codelabs that guide participants through using Google's Generative AI technologies:

1. **CODELAB 1: Google Generative AI SDK Notes** - Introduction to the Google Generative AI Python SDK
2. **CODELAB 2: Real-time RAG using Multimodal Live API with Gemini 2.0** - Building a Retrieval Augmented Generation system
3. **CODELAB 3** - Advanced applications and techniques (referenced as the formatting standard)

Each codelab follows a consistent educational format with numbered examples, detailed explanations, and step-by-step implementation guidance.

## CODELAB 1: Google Generative AI SDK Notes

This introductory codelab covers the fundamentals of using the Google Generative AI SDK for Python:

### Key Topics:

- **Installation and Setup**: Installing dependencies and configuring API access
- **Basic Text Generation**: Creating simple prompts and generating text responses
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjusting temperature, top_k, and top_p for different response styles
- **Safety Settings**: Implementing content safety controls and handling blocked content
- **Counting Tokens**: Understanding token usage and optimizing prompt efficiency
- **Chat Conversations**: Creating multi-turn conversations with message history
- **System Instructions**: Using system prompts to guide model behavior
- **Function Calling**: Implementing structured function calls with the model
- **Embeddings**: Creating and using text embeddings for semantic similarity
- **Multimodal Inputs**: Working with text and image inputs together

### Educational Approach:

Each example provides executable code snippets with comprehensive explanations that detail the purpose, functionality, and implementation considerations.

## CODELAB 2: Real-time RAG using Multimodal Live API with Gemini 2.0

This intermediate codelab teaches participants how to build a complete Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the Multimodal Live API:

### Key Topics:

- **Environment Setup**: Installing dependencies and configuring authentication
- **Multimodal Live API**: Understanding real-time, low-latency communication
- **Document Processing**: Converting PDFs to text chunks for knowledge retrieval
- **Embedding Generation**: Creating vector representations of documents
- **Vector Search**: Implementing similarity-based document retrieval
- **Text Generation**: Producing contextually grounded answers from documents
- **Audio Generation**: Creating spoken responses using the same RAG pipeline
- **RAG Architecture**: Building a complete pipeline from document indexing to answer generation
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust retry logic and error management
- **Interactive Applications**: Creating conversational interfaces for RAG systems

### RAG Implementation:

The codelab builds a complete RAG system with separate, well-defined components:

1. **Document Processing and Embedding**: Converting documents to searchable vectors
2. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant document chunks based on user queries
3. **Generation**: Creating factual, grounded answers using retrieved context
4. **Pipeline Integration**: Connecting components into a seamless workflow

### Real-World Application:

The codelab uses a practical retail scenario (Cymbal Bikes shop) to demonstrate how RAG helps answer specific customer questions using company documentation.

## CODELAB 3

This advanced codelab (used as the formatting reference) appears to cover more sophisticated implementation patterns and advanced use cases, establishing the educational format that was applied to standardize all materials.

## Educational Format

All codelabs now follow a consistent, highly structured format:

- **Clear Example Titles**: Each file starts with "Example #" and a descriptive title
- **Python Syntax Highlighting**: All code blocks use proper markdown syntax highlighting
- **Comprehensive Comments**: Code includes detailed, explanatory comments
- **Structured Explanations**: Each example includes a numbered explanation section with:
  - Component descriptions
  - Implementation details
  - Best practices
  - Technical considerations
- **Modular Organization**: Complex examples are split into multiple files for better comprehension
- **Progressive Complexity**: Examples build on previous concepts in a logical sequence

## Technical Implementation

The codelabs demonstrate a progression of technical capabilities:

1. **Basic SDK Usage**: Direct API calls for text generation
2. **Interactive Systems**: Chat-based interfaces with conversation history
3. **RAG Implementation**: Integration of generative AI with document retrieval
4. **Multimodal Outputs**: Both text and audio response generation
5. **Production Considerations**: Error handling, retry logic, and system architecture

## Conclusion

These three codelabs provide a comprehensive educational journey from basic generative AI concepts to sophisticated RAG implementations with multimodal capabilities. The consistent formatting and educational structure make the material approachable while covering advanced technical concepts in depth.
