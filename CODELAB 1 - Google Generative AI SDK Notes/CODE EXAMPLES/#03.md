# Example 3: Importing Required Libraries for Gen AI SDK

This example shows how to import all the necessary libraries and types for working with the Gemini SDK.

```python
# Import standard libraries
import datetime

# Import main Generative AI module
from google import genai

# Import Generative AI types
from google.genai.types import (
    CreateBatchJobConfig,
    CreateCachedContentConfig,
    EmbedContentConfig,
    FunctionDeclaration,
    GenerateContentConfig,
    HarmBlockThreshold,
    HarmCategory,
    Part,
    SafetySetting,
    Tool,
)
```

## Explanation

This code imports the necessary libraries and types for working with the Google Gen AI SDK:

1. **Standard Libraries**:

   - `datetime`: Used for handling timestamps and time-related operations, particularly when working with batch processing jobs and setting cache expiration times.

2. **Core SDK Module**:

   - `from google import genai`: Imports the main GenAI module which is the foundation of the SDK and provides access to models and client functionality.

3. **Type Definitions**:

   - These specialized classes from `google.genai.types` enable different SDK features:
     - `CreateBatchJobConfig`: Configures batch processing jobs for processing multiple requests asynchronously
     - `CreateCachedContentConfig`: Sets up context caching to improve efficiency and reduce token usage
     - `EmbedContentConfig`: Configures text embedding generation with options like dimensionality
     - `FunctionDeclaration`: Defines functions that models can call as part of function calling capabilities
     - `GenerateContentConfig`: Controls model generation parameters like temperature and safety settings
     - `HarmBlockThreshold` & `HarmCategory`: Configure safety filters to control content generation
     - `Part`: Constructs multimodal inputs combining text, images, and other media types
     - `SafetySetting`: Defines safety boundaries for model outputs
     - `Tool`: Packages functions or other tools (like search) for model use

4. **Importance**:
   - These imports provide all the necessary components to access the full range of Gemini capabilities
   - From basic text generation to advanced features like function calling and multimodal processing
   - Having these imports at the beginning of your code ensures all required components are available

These imports establish the foundation for all interactions with Gemini models through the SDK, enabling a wide range of AI-powered capabilities in your applications.
