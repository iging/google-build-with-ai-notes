# Example 6: Text-to-Text Generation

This example demonstrates how to send a simple text prompt to Gemini and process the response.

```python
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Send a text prompt to the model
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="What's the largest planet in our solar system?"
)

# Print the text response
print(response.text)

# Display the response as formatted markdown
display(Markdown("**Formatted Response:**"))
display(Markdown(response.text))
```

## Explanation

This code demonstrates the fundamental interaction with Gemini models - sending a text prompt and processing the response:

1. **Request Construction**:

   - Uses the `generate_content()` method to interact with the Gemini model.
   - Specifies the previously defined `MODEL_ID` to select which model to use.
   - Provides a simple text prompt as the `contents` parameter.
   - This is the most basic form of interaction with the model.

2. **Response Handling**:

   - The `response` object contains the complete model response including:
     - Generated text content
     - Safety ratings
     - Usage metadata (tokens)
     - Finish reason
   - Uses `response.text` to extract just the text portion of the response.

3. **Markdown Rendering**:

   - Imports IPython's display utilities for rich output in notebook environments.
   - The `display(Markdown())` function renders the response text with proper formatting.
   - This is particularly useful when:
     - The model returns structured text like lists or tables
     - The response contains code blocks or formatting
     - You want to enhance readability of the output

4. **Pattern Importance**:
   - This request-response pattern is the foundation for all interactions with Gemini.
   - More complex use cases build upon this basic pattern with additional parameters and configuration.
   - Understanding this simple flow is essential before moving to advanced features.

This example shows the simplest way to leverage Gemini's text generation capabilities, setting the foundation for more complex interactions in subsequent examples.
