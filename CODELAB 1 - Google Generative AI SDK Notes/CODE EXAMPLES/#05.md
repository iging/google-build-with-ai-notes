# Example 5: Model Selection

This example demonstrates how to select the appropriate Gemini model for your specific use case.

```python
# Choose a Gemini model based on your needs
MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.0-flash-001"  # @param {type: "string"}

# Print information about the selected model
print(f"Selected model: {MODEL_ID}")
```

## Explanation

This code selects which Gemini model to use for your generative AI tasks:

1. **Model Selection**:

   - Sets the `MODEL_ID` variable to specify which Gemini model version to use.
   - The `@param` annotation makes this an interactive parameter in notebook environments.
   - The chosen model determines the capabilities, speed, and cost of your AI interactions.

2. **Available Models**:

   - **gemini-2.0-flash-001**: Optimized for faster responses and lower latency
   - **gemini-2.0-pro-001**: Higher quality outputs with more nuanced understanding
   - **gemini-2.0-ultra-001**: The most capable model for complex reasoning tasks
   - **gemini-1.5-pro-001**: Previous generation model with different capabilities

3. **Model Selection Factors**:

   - **Performance vs. Speed**: Higher capability models may have higher latency
   - **Cost Efficiency**: Flash models generally cost less per request than Pro or Ultra
   - **Task Complexity**: More complex tasks benefit from more powerful models
   - **Multimodal Needs**: Some models have better image/video understanding

4. **Version Significance**:
   - The "-001" suffix indicates a stable, versioned model endpoint
   - Versioned models maintain consistent behavior over time
   - Preview models (with "preview" in the name) may change behavior without notice

This model selection will be used for all subsequent API calls until explicitly changed. Choosing the right model is essential for balancing performance, cost, and capabilities for your specific application needs.
