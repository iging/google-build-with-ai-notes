# Example 4: Client Setup and Project Configuration

This example demonstrates how to set up the Google Cloud project configuration and initialize the Gemini client.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import os
from google import genai

# Set up Google Cloud project information
PROJECT_ID = "[your-project-id]"  # @param {type: "string", placeholder: "[your-project-id]", isTemplate: true}
if not PROJECT_ID or PROJECT_ID == "[your-project-id]":
    PROJECT_ID = str(os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"))

LOCATION = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION", "global")

# Create the client with Vertex AI
client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

# Set the model ID for Gemini
MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.0-flash-001"
```

## Explanation

This code sets up the Google Cloud project configuration and initializes the client needed to access Gemini models:

1. **Project Configuration**:

   - Sets up the `PROJECT_ID` variable identifying your Google Cloud project.
   - The `@param` annotation creates an interactive parameter in notebook environments like Colab.
   - Includes a fallback mechanism to retrieve the project ID from environment variables if not explicitly specified.
   - Defines the `LOCATION` variable (defaulting to "global") which determines the Google Cloud region where API resources are accessed.

2. **Client Initialization**:

   - Creates a `genai.Client` instance configured to use Vertex AI.
   - The `vertexai=True` parameter specifies using Vertex AI as the backend service instead of the direct Google AI API.
   - Provides the project ID and location for proper API routing and billing.
   - This client object will be used for all interactions with the Gemini models.

3. **Model Selection**:

   - Sets the `MODEL_ID` to "gemini-2.0-flash-001", specifying which version of Gemini to use.
   - This identifies the specific model capabilities and performance characteristics.
   - The model ID is required for all content generation requests.

4. **Importance**:
   - This configuration establishes your identity and permissions for API access.
   - The client is the primary interface for all SDK operations including content generation, chat creation, and embeddings.
   - Setting the correct project ID ensures proper billing and resource management.
   - The location parameter can affect model availability and data residency.

This setup is required before making any API calls to the Gemini models and forms the foundation for all subsequent interactions with the SDK.
