# Example 1: Installation and Setup

This example shows how to install the Google Gen AI Python SDK and set up the necessary environment.

```python
# Install the Google Gen AI SDK
%pip install --upgrade --quiet google-genai pandas
```

## Explanation

This code performs the initial setup required to use the Google Gen AI SDK:

1. **Installation**:

   - Uses pip to install the `google-genai` package, which provides the Python client for Google's Generative AI.
   - Also installs `pandas`, a data manipulation library that will be useful for handling structured data.
   - The `--quiet` flag minimizes output, and `--upgrade` ensures you have the latest version.

2. **IPython Magic Command**:

   - The `%pip` is a Jupyter notebook magic command that allows  running pip directly in a cell.
   - This is particularly useful in notebook environments like Google Colab or Jupyter.

3. **Purpose**:
   - This installation step is required before using any of the Google Gen AI features.
   - The SDK provides all the necessary functions and classes to interact with models like Gemini.
   - Installing dependencies at the beginning ensures your environment is properly set up.

This is the first step in your journey to using Google's generative AI models through the SDK.
