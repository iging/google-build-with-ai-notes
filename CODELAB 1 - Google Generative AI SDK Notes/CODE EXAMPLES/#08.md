# Example 8: System Instructions

This example demonstrates how to use system instructions to guide the model's behavior and customize its responses.

```python
from google.genai.types import GenerateContentConfig
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Define a system instruction that sets the model's role
system_instruction = """
  You are a helpful language translator.
  Your mission is to translate text in English to French.
  Always maintain a professional tone in your translations.
"""

# Create the user prompt
prompt = """
  User input: I like bagels.
  Answer:
"""

# Generate content with system instruction
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=prompt,
    config=GenerateContentConfig(
        system_instruction=system_instruction,
    ),
)

# Display the response
print("Model response:")
print(response.text)

# Display as markdown for better formatting
display(Markdown("**Formatted Translation:**"))
display(Markdown(response.text))
```

## Explanation

This code demonstrates how to use system instructions to define a specific role and behavior for the Gemini model:

1. **System Instruction Definition**:

   - Creates a multiline string that sets expectations for the model's behavior.
   - Defines the model's role as a "helpful language translator".
   - Specifies the task: translating English text to French.
   - Adds guidance on maintaining a professional tone.
   - System instructions are not shown to the end user but guide how the model responds.

2. **User Prompt Construction**:

   - Defines the actual content sent to the model as a separate variable.
   - Contains the English text that needs translation.
   - Formatted in a clear way to indicate what requires a response.

3. **Configuration Setup**:

   - Uses `GenerateContentConfig` to create a structured configuration object.
   - Passes the system instruction through this configuration.
   - This separates model behavior instructions from the actual content being processed.

4. **Content Generation**:

   - The standard `generate_content()` method is used but with the added configuration.
   - The model processes both the system instruction and user prompt together.
   - The system instruction shapes how the model interprets and responds to the prompt.

5. **Key Benefits**:
   - **Consistency**: System instructions help maintain consistent behavior across multiple interactions.
   - **Specialization**: Allows customizing the model for specific roles without complex prompting.
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly distinguishes between behavioral guidance and actual content.
   - **Improved Quality**: Provides context that helps the model generate more relevant and appropriate responses.

System instructions are particularly valuable for creating specialized assistants (like translators, tutors, or domain experts), enforcing output formats, and maintaining consistent tone or style throughout an interaction.
