# Example 4: Google Cloud Project Configuration

This example shows how to set up the Google Cloud project configuration needed for accessing Vertex AI services.

```python
# Import the os module for environment variable access
import os

# Set up Google Cloud project information
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"  # @param {type: "string", placeholder: "[your-project-id]", isTemplate: true}
if not PROJECT_ID or PROJECT_ID == "[your-project-id]":
    PROJECT_ID = str(os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"))

# Set the Google Cloud region
LOCATION = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION", "us-central1")

print(f"Using project: {PROJECT_ID}")
print(f"Using location: {LOCATION}")
```

## Explanation

This code sets up the Google Cloud project configuration required for accessing Vertex AI services:

1. **Project Configuration**:

   - Sets up the `PROJECT_ID` variable which uniquely identifies your Google Cloud project.
   - Uses a parameter placeholder that can be filled in interactively in notebook environments.
   - Includes a fallback mechanism that retrieves the project ID from environment variables if not explicitly specified.
   - The project ID is essential as it determines which Google Cloud project will be billed for API usage.

2. **Region Selection**:

   - Defines the `LOCATION` variable which specifies the Google Cloud region.
   - Defaults to "us-central1" if no region is specified in environment variables.
   - The region affects data residency, model availability, and sometimes pricing.
   - Different regions may have different available services or model versions.

3. **Environment Integration**:

   - Uses `os.environ.get()` to access environment variables, making the code adaptable to different execution environments.
   - This approach works consistently across Colab, Vertex AI Workbench, and local environments.
   - Provides sensible defaults when environment variables aren't set.

4. **Importance for RAG Implementation**:
   - Proper configuration ensures API calls are routed to the correct project.
   - Affects which models are available for text generation and embedding creation.
   - Determines where usage is logged and billed.
   - Can impact performance based on geographical proximity to the selected region.

This configuration step forms the foundation for all subsequent interactions with Google Cloud services in our RAG system, particularly for accessing Vertex AI models for embeddings and text generation.
