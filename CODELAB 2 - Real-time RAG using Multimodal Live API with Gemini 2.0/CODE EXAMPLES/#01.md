# Example 1: Installing Dependencies

This example shows how to install the necessary libraries for implementing RAG using the Multimodal Live API with Gemini 2.0.

```python
# Install required packages
%%capture

%pip install --upgrade --quiet google-genai PyPDF2
```

## Explanation

This code installs the required libraries needed to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system with Gemini 2.0:

1. **Package Installation**:

   - Uses pip to install two key libraries needed for our implementation.
   - The `%%capture` magic command suppresses installation output to keep the notebook clean.
   - The `--upgrade` flag ensures you get the latest versions of the packages.
   - The `--quiet` flag reduces verbose output during installation.

2. **Required Libraries**:

   - `google-genai`: Google's Python client library for accessing Gemini API capabilities, providing interfaces for:

     - Text generation
     - Audio generation
     - Embedding creation
     - Multimodal Live API access

   - `PyPDF2`: A PDF processing library that enables:
     - Reading PDF documents
     - Extracting text from PDFs
     - Processing document content for our RAG pipeline

3. **Why These Libraries**:

   - The Gemini SDK is essential for interfacing with Google's generative AI models.
   - PyPDF2 allows us to process PDF documents, which will be our knowledge source for the RAG system.
   - Together, these libraries provide the foundation for building a system that can answer questions based on document content.

This installation step is crucial as it provides all the necessary tools to build a complete RAG pipeline from document processing to answer generation.
