# Example 7: Document Acquisition for RAG

This example shows how to download and prepare domain-specific documents that will serve as the knowledge base for our RAG system.

```python
# Create documents directory if it doesn't exist
!mkdir -p documents

# Download retail-specific documents from Google Cloud Storage
!gsutil cp "gs://github-repo/generative-ai/gemini2/use-cases/retail_rag/documents/CymbalBikesReturnPolicy.pdf" "documents/CymbalBikesReturnPolicy.pdf"
!gsutil cp "gs://github-repo/generative-ai/gemini2/use-cases/retail_rag/documents/CymbalBikesServices.pdf" "documents/CymbalBikesServices.pdf"

# List downloaded documents to verify
import glob
documents = glob.glob("documents/*")
print(f"Downloaded documents: {documents}")
```

## Explanation

This code demonstrates how to acquire domain-specific documents for a RAG system focused on a retail customer support use case:

1. **Document Acquisition**:

   - Uses `gsutil` commands to download PDF documents from a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
   - The `!` prefix executes these as shell commands directly from the notebook environment.
   - Creates a local "documents" directory to store the downloaded files.
   - Downloads two key documents relevant to our fictional bicycle shop called "Cymbal Bikes":
     - Return Policy: Contains rules and procedures for product returns
     - Services: Lists bike services offered, with descriptions and pricing

2. **Use Case Context**:

   - The example is built around a fictional bicycle shop to demonstrate a practical RAG application.
   - This retail customer support scenario represents a common business use case where RAG provides significant value.
   - The system aims to answer customer questions using information from official store documents.

3. **Business Value**:

   - **Faster Issue Resolution**: Customers get immediate answers without searching through websites or waiting for support.
   - **Operational Efficiency**: Automated answers for common questions free up human agents for complex issues.
   - **24/7 Availability**: Provides consistent support regardless of time zone or business hours.
   - **Information Consistency**: Ensures all answers reflect the most accurate and up-to-date policies.

4. **RAG Implementation Requirements**:
   - **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: The documents contain specialized information that general LLMs wouldn't know.
   - **Ground Truth Source**: These documents serve as the authoritative source for factual answers.
   - **Controlled Testing**: Using pre-selected documents creates a clear evaluation framework for RAG accuracy.

These documents form the knowledge corpus that our RAG system will index, search, and use to ground responses, ensuring answers are factually accurate and specific to our business context.
