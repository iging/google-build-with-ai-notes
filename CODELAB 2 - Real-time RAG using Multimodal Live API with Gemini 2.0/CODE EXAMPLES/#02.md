# Example 2: Restarting Runtime Environment

This example demonstrates how to restart the Jupyter kernel to ensure that newly installed packages are properly loaded.

```python
# Import the IPython module
import IPython

# Get the current application instance
app = IPython.Application.instance()

# Restart the kernel
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)

# The execution stops here as the kernel restarts
```

## Explanation

This code restarts the Jupyter kernel to ensure all newly installed packages are properly loaded:

1. **Runtime Management**:

   - Uses the IPython library to access the current application instance.
   - The `do_shutdown(True)` method initiates a graceful shutdown and restart of the kernel.
   - The `True` parameter ensures the restart happens in a controlled manner.

2. **Purpose of Kernel Restart**:

   - When you install packages in a running Jupyter environment, they aren't immediately available to the Python interpreter.
   - Restarting the kernel ensures all installed packages are properly loaded into memory.
   - This is necessary because Python imports packages at the time they're first imported, not dynamically during runtime.

3. **Runtime Behavior**:

   - After executing this code, the kernel will shut down and restart.
   - This process typically takes 5-30 seconds depending on your environment.
   - Any variables or functions defined before the restart will be lost and need to be redefined.
   - The notebook will display a notification that the kernel is restarting.

4. **Best Practice**:

   - Always restart the kernel after installing new packages to ensure they're properly available.
   - Wait for the kernel to completely restart before continuing with subsequent cells.
   - This practice prevents hard-to-debug errors related to missing or partially loaded packages.

This step is essential in our workflow to ensure that both the Google Gen AI SDK and PyPDF2 libraries are fully available for the RAG implementation that follows.
