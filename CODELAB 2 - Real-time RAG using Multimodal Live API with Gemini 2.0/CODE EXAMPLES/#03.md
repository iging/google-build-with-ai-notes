# Example 3: Google Colab Authentication

This example demonstrates how to authenticate with Google Cloud when running in a Colab environment.

```python
# Import system module
import sys

# Check if running in Google Colab
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Import the authentication module
    from google.colab import auth

    # Authenticate the user
    auth.authenticate_user()
    print("Authentication completed successfully.")
else:
    print("Not running in Google Colab. Authentication may need to be handled differently.")
```

## Explanation

This code handles authentication specifically for Google Colab environments:

1. **Environment Detection**:

   - The code first checks if it's running in a Google Colab environment by looking for "google.colab" in the loaded Python modules.
   - This ensures that the authentication method is only applied in the appropriate environment.
   - Different environments (local development, Cloud Workbench, etc.) may require different authentication methods.

2. **Conditional Authentication**:

   - If running in Colab, it imports the authentication module from `google.colab`.
   - The `auth.authenticate_user()` function launches a browser-based authentication flow, allowing the user to log in with their Google account.
   - This creates proper credentials for accessing Google Cloud services from within Colab.
   - A success message is printed when authentication completes.

3. **Purpose**:

   - Authentication is necessary because the RAG implementation will use Google Cloud services which require proper authorization.
   - Specifically, we need authenticated access to Vertex AI for model inference and embedding generation.
   - This step must be completed before making any API calls to Google Cloud services.

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - The authentication process creates temporary credentials stored in the Colab environment.
   - These credentials expire after a period of time or when the Colab session ends.
   - No sensitive information is stored in the notebook code itself.
   - It's important to use an account with appropriate permissions for the Google Cloud project being used.

This authentication step ensures secure access to Google Cloud resources and is essential for all subsequent API calls in our RAG implementation.
