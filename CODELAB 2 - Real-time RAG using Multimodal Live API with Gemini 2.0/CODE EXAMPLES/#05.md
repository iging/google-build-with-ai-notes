# Example 5: Importing Required Libraries

This example shows how to import all the necessary libraries for building a RAG system with the Multimodal Live API.

```python
# For asynchronous operations
import asyncio

# For data processing
import glob
from typing import Any

from IPython.display import Audio, Markdown, display
import PyPDF2

# For GenerativeAI
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from google.genai.types import LiveConnectConfig
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# For similarity score
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# For retry mechanism
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_random_exponential
```

## Explanation

This code imports all the necessary libraries for building a comprehensive RAG system:

1. **Asynchronous Programming Tools**:

   - `asyncio`: Enables asynchronous programming, which is essential for:
     - Creating responsive applications that handle multiple operations concurrently
     - Managing streaming responses from the Live API
     - Implementing non-blocking operations for better user experience

2. **Document Processing Libraries**:

   - `glob`: For finding files matching specific patterns when processing multiple documents
   - `PyPDF2`: For extracting text content from PDF documents
   - `typing.Any`: For type hinting to improve code readability and IDE support

3. **Display and Visualization**:

   - `IPython.display`: Provides rich output options in notebook environments:
     - `Audio`: For playing audio responses from the Live API
     - `Markdown`: For formatting text with rich styling
     - `display`: For rendering various output types

4. **Generative AI and Data Processing**:

   - `genai`: Google's Generative AI library for accessing Gemini models
   - `types` and `LiveConnectConfig`: For configuring model parameters and Live API connections
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations, particularly when processing audio data
   - `pandas`: For structured data manipulation and storage of document embeddings

5. **Vector Similarity**:

   - `cosine_similarity`: From scikit-learn, used to calculate similarity between vector embeddings
   - This is a core component of retrieval mechanisms in RAG

6. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - `tenacity`: Implements robust retry logic for API calls with features like:
     - Exponential backoff with randomization
     - Maximum attempt limits
     - Exception filtering

These libraries work together to form a complete toolkit for implementing all aspects of our RAG system: document processing, embedding generation, similarity search, asynchronous communication, and multimodal response handling.
