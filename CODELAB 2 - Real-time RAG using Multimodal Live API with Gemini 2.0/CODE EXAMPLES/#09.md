## Grounding

Grounding is crucial in this scenario because the model needs to access and process relevant information from external sources (the "Cymbal Bikes Return Policy" and "Cymbal Bikes Services" documents) to answer specific queries accurately. Without grounding, the model relies solely on its pre-trained knowledge, which may not contain the specific details about the bike store's policies.

In the example, the question about the return policy for bike helmets at Cymbal Bikes cannot be answered correctly without accessing the provided documents. The model's general knowledge of return policies is insufficient. Grounding allows the model to:

1. **Retrieve relevant information:** The system must first locate the pertinent sections within the provided documents that address the user's question about bike helmet returns.

2. **Process and synthesize information:** After retrieving relevant passages, the model must then understand and synthesize the information to construct an accurate answer.

3. **Generate a grounded response:** Finally, the response needs to be directly derived from the factual content of the documents. This ensures accuracy and avoids hallucinations â€“ generating incorrect or nonsensical information not present in the source documents.

Without grounding, the model is forced to guess or extrapolate from its general knowledge, which can lead to inaccurate or misleading responses. The grounding process makes the model's responses more reliable and trustworthy, especially for domain-specific knowledge like store policies or procedures.

## Multimodal Live API

The multimodal live API enables you to build low-latency, multi-modal applications. It currently supports text as input and text & audio as output.

- Low Latency, where audio output is required, where the Text-to-Speech step can be skipped
- Provides a more interactive user experience.
- Suitable for applications requiring immediate audio feedback

See the [Multimodal Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/multimodal-live) page for more details.

#### Asynchronous (async) operation

When to use async calls:

1. **I/O-bound operations**: When your code spends a significant amount of time waiting for external resources
   (e.g., network requests, file operations, database queries). Async allows other tasks to run while waiting.  
   This is especially beneficial for real-time applications or when dealing with multiple concurrent requests.

   Example:

   - Fetching data from a remote server.

2. **Parallel tasks**: When you have independent tasks that can run concurrently without blocking each other. Async
   allows you to efficiently utilize multiple CPU cores or network connections.

   Example:

   - Processing a large number of prompts and generating audio for each.

3. **User interfaces**: In applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), async operations prevent the UI from
   freezing while performing long-running tasks. Users can interact with the interface even when background
   operations are active.

   Example:

   - A chatbot interacting in real time, where an audio response is generated in the background.

### Text

For text generation, you need to set the `response_modalities` to `TEXT`

```python
import asyncio
from google.genai.types import LiveConnectConfig
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

async def generate_content(query: str) -> str:
    """Function to generate text content using Gemini live API.

    Args:
      query: The query to generate content for.

    Returns:
      The generated content as a string.
    """
    # Configure the session for text output
    config = LiveConnectConfig(response_modalities=["TEXT"])

    # Establish connection with the model
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=MODEL, config=config) as session:

        # Send the query and mark end of turn
        await session.send(input=query, end_of_turn=True)

        # Collect response in chunks
        response = []
        async for message in session.receive():
            try:
                if message.text:
                    response.append(message.text)
            except AttributeError:
                pass

            # Check if the response is complete
            if message.server_content.turn_complete:
                response = "".join(str(x) for x in response)
                return response

# Test the function with our sample query
async def test_text_generation():
    query = "What is the price of a basic tune-up at Cymbal Bikes?"

    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print("\nGenerating response...")

    response = await generate_content(query)
    print("\nResponse:")
    display(Markdown(response))

# Execute the test function
await test_text_generation()
```

## Explanation

This code demonstrates how to use the Multimodal Live API for text generation:

1. **Async/Await Pattern**:

   - Uses asynchronous programming for non-blocking operations.
   - The `async` keyword defines coroutines that can be paused and resumed.
   - The `await` keyword pauses execution until the awaited operation completes.
   - This pattern is essential for handling real-time streaming responses efficiently.

2. **Live API Configuration**:

   - Uses `LiveConnectConfig` to specify `response_modalities=["TEXT"]`, indicating we want text output.
   - The Live API uses WebSockets for real-time communication, providing lower latency than traditional REST APIs.
   - Establishes a session using `client.aio.live.connect()` with our model and configuration.

3. **Session Management**:

   - Uses Python's async context manager (`async with`) to properly handle connection lifecycle.
   - This ensures the session is properly closed when done, even if errors occur.
   - The session object manages the WebSocket connection to the Gemini model.

4. **Request Handling**:

   - Sends the user query using `session.send()` with `end_of_turn=True` to indicate it's a complete message.
   - This is similar to pressing "send" in a chat interface.

5. **Streaming Response Processing**:

   - Uses an asynchronous iterator (`async for`) to process response chunks as they arrive.
   - Collects text fragments in the `response` list as they stream in.
   - Handles potential `AttributeError` exceptions that might occur if a message doesn't contain text.
   - Monitors for the `turn_complete` flag to know when the full response has been received.
   - Joins the collected fragments into a single response string.

6. **Test Implementation**:
   - Includes a sample test function that demonstrates usage with our bicycle shop query.
   - Displays the response using Markdown formatting for better readability.
   - Shows the complete workflow from query to formatted response.

The Multimodal Live API offers several advantages over standard API calls, including:

- Lower latency for real-time applications
- Streaming responses for faster initial response time
- WebSocket-based communication for persistent connections
- Support for multiple modalities through a unified interface

### Audio

- For audio generation, you need to set the `response_modalities` to `AUDIO`
