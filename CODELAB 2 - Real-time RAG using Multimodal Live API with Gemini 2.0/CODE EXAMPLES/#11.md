# Example 11: Introduction to RAG Architecture

This example introduces the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and prepares the document foundation for implementation.

```python
import glob
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Load the previously downloaded documents
documents = glob.glob("documents/*")

# Display the list of available documents
print("Available documents for RAG implementation:")
for doc in documents:
    print(f"- {doc}")

# Preview document count
print(f"\nTotal documents: {len(documents)}")
```

## Explanation

This code introduces Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and prepares the document foundation for its implementation:

1. **RAG Fundamentals**:

   - RAG enhances LLM accuracy by retrieving relevant context from external documents before generating responses.
   - This approach grounds model outputs in factual information, reducing hallucinations.
   - The Multimodal Live API provides an ideal platform for implementing real-time RAG with both text and audio outputs.
   - WebSocket-based communication enables persistent connections essential for real-time applications.

2. **Document Access**:

   - Uses Python's `glob` module to identify all documents in the "documents" directory.
   - These documents (containing Cymbal Bikes policies and services) will form our knowledge base.
   - The documents were downloaded earlier in the workshop and contain domain-specific information.
   - Document access is the first step in the RAG pipeline - identifying the sources of ground truth.

3. **RAG Pipeline Components**:

   - **Data Preparation**:
     - Chunking: Dividing documents into manageable pieces
     - Embedding: Converting text chunks to vector representations
     - Indexing: Organizing embeddings for efficient search
   - **Inference Process**:
     - Retrieval: Finding relevant document chunks for a query
     - Query Augmentation: Combining the query with retrieved context
     - Generation: Creating a response based on the augmented query

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - We'll build the RAG pipeline from scratch to understand each component in detail.
   - This "build it yourself" approach provides deeper insight than using pre-built frameworks.
   - Alternative approaches using LangChain or LlamaIndex are available for production systems.
   - The custom implementation allows for targeted optimization and full control over each step.

This example sets the foundation for our RAG implementation by identifying the document sources that will provide factual grounding for our model responses.
