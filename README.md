# GDG Build with AI Workshop

This repository contains materials for the "Build with AI" workshop series, focusing on practical implementations of Google's Generative AI technologies.

## üìö Workshop Overview

The workshop consists of three progressive codelabs that guide participants through using Google's Generative AI technologies:

1. **CODELAB 1: Google Generative AI SDK Notes** - Introduction to the Google Generative AI Python SDK
2. **CODELAB 2: Real-time RAG using Multimodal Live API with Gemini 2.0** - Building a Retrieval Augmented Generation system
3. **CODELAB 3: Getting Started with the Live API using Gen AI SDK** - Advanced applications and techniques

## üß© Codelab Contents

### Codelab 1: Google Generative AI SDK Notes

- Basic SDK setup and configuration

- More sophisticated use cases
- Production-ready implementation techniques

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Each codelab contains:

- A detailed `notes.md` file with conceptual explanations
- A `CODE EXAMPLES` directory with practical implementations

To begin:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the codelab of your choice
3. Review the `notes.md` file to understand concepts
4. Explore the code examples in sequential order

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Google API key for Vertex AI/Gemini access
